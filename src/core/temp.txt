Specialized Operations:

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: A special pair of values and vectors for a square matrix. When a matrix is multiplied by its eigenvector, the result is the same as the eigenvector being scaled by its eigenvalue.

LU Decomposition: A method of factoring a matrix into a lower triangular matrix (L), an upper triangular matrix (U), and a permutation matrix (P) such that PA=LU.

QR Decomposition: A factorization of a matrix into an orthogonal matrix (Q) and an upper triangular matrix (R).

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): A powerful factorization of any matrix into three matrices: U, Î£, and V T
